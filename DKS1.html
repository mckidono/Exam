		Dark Souls employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from non-player characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design.
<br/>
<br/>
The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world. In this period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the "First Flame" and finds the "Lord Souls." He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing some humans to resurrect upon death constantly.
<br/>
<br/>
The player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the Lord Souls must be acquired from Gwyn's primordial allies and returned to the flame. Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player has the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.

		Asylum Demon<br/>The large demon found during the tutorial in the Northern Undead Asylum. This boss is very similar to the Vanguard in Demon's Souls in both attack style and appearance in the story. After escaping from your cell and lighting the first bonfire, the next step is to open a large set of doors leading to another courtyard, surrounded by large vases.

Similar to the Bell Gargoyles encountered later, the Taurus Demon does not immediately appear when the host passes through the fog gate. Rather, the host must travel approximately halfway across the section before the boss appears atop the far tower and leaps down.

		Dark Sun Gwyndolin<br/>The last born of Lord Gwyn, Gwyndolin is the leader of the Blade of the Dark Moon covenant and the only remaining deity in Anor Londo. Gwyndolin's followers are few, but their tasks are of vital importance. Although born male, due to magic and association with the moon, Gwyndolin was raised as a daughter but is biologically a male and is reffered to as such from Gwynevere who lovingly calls him brother. Gwyndolin created the illusion of a sister Gwynevere, who helps guard over Anor Londo. An unmasking of these deities would be tantamount to blasphemy.

		Crossbreed Priscilla<br/>Half dragon boss found in Painted World of Ariamis. An optional boss, she wields a giant scythe and has the ability to turn invisible. If you do not wish to fight her, simply walk past her after talking to her, and proceed towards the open ledge to trigger a cutscene and your return to Anor Londo (speaking with her doesn't make her aggressive).

		Centipede Demon<br/>This demon is a large bug like creature which defends the path to Lost Izalith. Its arms and tail are separate living centipedes. The boss has a tendency to stand on the lava after walking through the fog gate and repeatedly use his reaching attack. For someone who is not in possession of the Orange Charred Ring or ranged attacks, this can be extremely annoying.

		Four Kings<br/>The wraith-like remnants of the four leaders of New Londo Ruins who fell to dark after being tempted with the art of lifedrain. Defeating the Four Kings is necessary to the plot, and is also necessary for those players wishing to join the Darkwraith covenant; those wishing to join the covenant must defeat the Four Kings before obtaining the Lordvessel from Anor Londo, and talking to Kingseeker Frampt.

		Bed of Chaos<br/>In a futile attempt to prolong the Age of Fire, the Witch of Izalith tried to recreate the First Flame. The ritual was a failure and its power formed a bed of life which would become the source of all demons; trapping two of her daughters in the orbs on either side, and herself within it

		Seath the Scaleless<br/>Envy and bitterness; words used to describe Seath's betrayal of his own kind; for unlike his brethren, Seath was born without the stone scales of the Everlasting Dragons. But with the help of Gravelord Nito and the Witch of Izalith, and Gwyn, the Lord of Cinder, Seath brought his own race to the brink of extinction, with many believing him to be the last of his kind.

His army of skeletons guard his tomb, while his Gravelord Servants spread death through the Eyes of Death.

		Gwyn Lord of Cinder<br/>Gwyn, Lord of Cinder was greatest of the gods and a mighty warrior. He was known as the Lord of Sunlight and headed the efforts to end the Age of Ancients, together with Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, and the dragon-traitor, Seath the Scaleless. Leading his knights, he led the Gods to victory and oversaw the Age of Fire. Despite bequeathing elements of his soul to the Four Kings and Seath the Scaleless, his soul remains "a powerful thing indeed."

Around a thousand years prior to the start of the game, Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the First Flame. His reasons for doing so are disputed, but what is certain is that his principal motivation was to postpone the end of the Age of Fire. He was succeeded by his children: his firstborn, the banished God of War who lost his status as a deity; his daughter Gwynevere, the Queen of Sunlight; and his lastborn Gwyndolin, his "repulsive [and] frail" son who Gwyn raised as a daughter due to his affinity for the moon.

It will come as no surprise to anyone who has spoken to Kingseeker Frampt, Darkstalker Kaathe, or the illusion of Gwynevere, that Lord Gwyn is the final boss of the game, and that it's the Chosen Undead's goal to either succeed him and end further Undead sacrifices, or start the Age of Dark: the apparent age of humanity. He can be fought after acquiring all Lord Souls and Lord Soul Shards and returning them to the Lordvessel at Firelink Altar, which will grant access to the Kiln of the First Flame. After fighting past five of his Black Knight, a Hollowed and haggard Gwyn awaits at the site of the First Flame, presenting himself as their final challenge.
